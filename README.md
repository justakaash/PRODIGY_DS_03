# PRODIGY_DS_03
My Third Project as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech.

I was assigned to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a
customer will purchase a product or service based on their
demographic and behavioral data and use a dataset such as
the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository.
